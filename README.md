# Quest

This program appeared Byte Magazine Volume 4, Number 7, July, 1979.
It was originally written for the 8K PET but as published, it was
converted to a "simpler dialect", as described in the article.  The
specific dialect is not named, and has been difficult to identify
because of the use of LST() and NDX() functions for manipulating
strings and because J=-1:N=RND(J) generates a number between zero
and one.
